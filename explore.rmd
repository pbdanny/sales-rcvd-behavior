# percen composition of each sales type by advisor group
prop.table(comp, 1)*100

```

As mosaic plot shown the different contribution sales type in each advisor group
A+ .. B : Have 'type 5 - high , switching' more than other group.
A+ : Have 'type 2 - moderate, continue'.
Pro : Mostly contributed by 'type 3 - New active' since mostly is the new sales, mostly bundle
DM : Interesting contributed most the 'type 1 - little, dormant'
